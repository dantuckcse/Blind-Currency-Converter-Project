To have this application run properly, you must run a localHost server through index2.html
This is to get the data and conversion to run properly. Without running a local server, the currencies will not output

To run a localserver on VisualStudio Code, download the Live Server extension. In VSCode, open index2.html, press "Control + p"(command + p on MacOS), press ">" and select "Live Server: Open with Live Serv√•er" This will automatically open the application with a running server on your default broswers

We also recommend using the built-in Screen reader in your operating system.
For Windows, press "Windows button + Control + Enter"
For MacOS, press "fn + Command + f5"
